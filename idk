Lipsum is a small Rust library for generating pseudo-Latin [lorem
ipsum filler text][lorem ipsum]. This is a standard placeholder text
used in publishing. It starts with:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
> eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim
> ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
> aliquip ex ea commodo consequat…

The text is generated using a [Markov chain] that has been trained on
the first book in Cicero's work *De finibus bonorum et malorum* (*On
the ends of good and evil*), of which the lorem ipsum text is a
scrambled subset.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
lipsum = "0.4"
```

and this to your crate root:
```rust
extern crate lipsum;
```


## Documentation

Please see the **[API documentation][api-docs]**.


## Getting Started

Use the `lipsum` function to generate lorem ipsum text:
```rust
extern crate lipsum;

use lipsum::lipsum;

fn main() {
    // Print 25 random words of lorem ipsum text.
    println!("{}", lipsum(25));
}
```

This generates the lorem ipsum text show above:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
> eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim
> ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco…

The text becomes random after 18 words, so you might not see exactly
the same text.


## Release History

This is a changelog with the most important changes in each release.

### Unreleased

The oldest supported version of Rust is now 1.8.

### Version 0.4.0 — September 24th, 2017

The `generate` and `generate_from` now always generate proper
sentences, meaning that they generate sentences that start with a
capital letter and end with `.` or some other punctuation character.
Use `iter` and `iter_from` directly if you need more control.

### Version 0.3.0 — July 28th, 2017

Performance is improved by about 50% when generating text, but
training the Markov chain now takes about twice as long as before.

The `MarkovChain` struct has many new methods:

* `new_with_rng` makes it possible to specify the random number
  generator used by the Markov chain. Use this to get deterministic
  and thus reproducible output for tests. `MarkovChain` now owns the
  RNG it uses and as a consequence, it has an extra type parameter.
  This is a breaking change if you used struct directly in your code.

* `iter` and `into_from` return iterators over words in the Markov
  chain. The `generate` and `generate_from` methods are now
  straight-forward convenience wrappers for the iterators.

* `len` tells you the number of stats in the Markov chain and
  `is_empty` tells you if the Markov chain is empty, meaning that it
  hasn't been trained on anything yet.

### Version 0.2.0 — July 10th, 2017

Rust version 1.6.0 is now supported. This is checked with TravisCI.

### Version 0.1.0 — July 2nd, 2017

First public release.
